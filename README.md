# Residential-Area-Management-System
Simple web application which stores and mains data of residents.

I have not focused on front end and presentation. Main goal was to make a web application using JSP and MySQL at backend.

Java Folder contains SQLConnectionBean.java file which contains methods for database operations. Make sure to change database connection details in the file.
Compile the SQLConnectionBean.java file and paste the SQLConnectionBean.class file in WEB-INF/classes/bean folder.

SQL folder contains sql file which contains the required tables and their layout.
